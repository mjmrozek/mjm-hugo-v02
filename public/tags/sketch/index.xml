      <description>During my time at university, I was constantly overwhelmed. Family, financial, and health issues, a physically demanding part-time job in a warehouse, exam stress at university, and a slew of other tasks and duties weighed on me so much that I lost my zest for life and often didn’t even want to get out of bed in the morning. In search of help in simplifying my life, Google quickly pointed me to an article from a psychology magazine that answered the question: “Getting through life with just two rules: Is it possible?</description>

      <description>My initial encounter with JP might be considered unusual. At some point, YouTube, for reasons unknown, directed my attention to a hearing in the Canadian Senate regarding Bill C-16. It wasn’t the content of the hearing that struck me but rather how JP presented himself.
