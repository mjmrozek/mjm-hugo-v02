**Journey**  

Initially, my resume was intended to focus solely on my academic qualifications. However, many of the defining events in my life have occurred outside of school, vocational training, or university. As such, a conventional resume can overlook significant moments, turning points, decisions, and challenges.

During the fifth World Government Summit in 2017, Mohammad Al Gergawi asked guest Elon Musk about his team selection process. Musk revealed that he relies on intuition and recurring questions about experiences, important decisions, and problems solved.

This approach inspired me to present my own journey similarly. The list below is not exhaustive; sometimes, I simply jot down questions first. Moreover, the list changes over time, just like circumstances, consciousness, and the perspective on one’s own past.

For instance, after only half a year, I’m somewhat critical of my comprehensive SVG sketch from the summer of 2022:

Under certain circumstances, I might answer some points in detail through blog posts. Here, I strive to articulate the key points in as few sentences as possible – as would be fitting for a conversation.

- Question: Outline your journey so far! How did you get here in the first place?  
- Decision: After graduating from high school, should I immediately pursue a university degree, or rather embark on a world tour first?  
- Decision: Choosing the right framework and appropriate tools for product development in the IT sector.  
- Decision: How do I navigate a professional reorientation?  
- Challenge: Internalizing a vast amount of information.  
- Challenge: Structuring a piece of text / Weaving a coherent narrative.  
- Challenge: Procrastination / Resistance.
